Helma's LSJ:
	Uses unicode rather than betacode for most things
	(looking at n915) Uses div2 rather than entryFree, head rather than orth for 1st orth tag, dispatches with TEIform attrib everywhere, i instead of tr, biblScope tag dispatched with
	to my surprise the reformat_lsj script does actual xml parsing, and it's pretty simple with perl
	helma's lsj is one entry per line, so may well not need to reformat.
	more likely will just need to lightly adjust the scripts in the face of the above tag name changes. bigger issue will be getting diogenes to use the unicode rather than betacode, but that shouldn't be too hard
		done the utils scripts for indexes, was easy
		have partially done the Perseus.cgi changes. needed to remove newlines to get binary search to work. is broadly working now, but there are at least 2 big bugs
			1) some of the unicode in the output is borked, seemingly when greek isn't in <foreign> tags
			2) the search text doesn't seem to match as much. for example searching λαμβάνω no longer finds it (and indeed in this case starts at a part of the dictionary quite different). not sure why yet
			3) clicking on any of the unicode in a dictionary entry will bring up borked text in the resulting dictionary page

Suetonius bibliographical references are incorrectly handled, resulting in an invalid jump
	perseus seem to have changed their referencing of him, from: Perseus:abo:phi,1348,001:life=gal.:16 to: urn:cts:latinLit:phi1348.phi017:16
	therefore need to add a mapping, either to the jumpTo part of diogenes or just in perseus-abo.pl.
	there may be other authors for whom this applies; ask Perseus / look for other 'strange' patterns in the original urns that may have been changed
	for the LSJ, at least, this may not be an issue once we switch to Helma's LSJ. Need to revisit once we have switched.

add a .desktop entry for linux
think about how best to enable installation on linux systems; will work from the directory, but ideally the diogenes script could be told a location it was installed to, so it could be elsewhere
add make install rule to install onto unix-like systems into system folders (so the diogenes-linux64 is an alternative, precompiled version, for people to stick on /opt or home, compared to this which is more for sysadmins / packagers)
add contributions / thanks prominently to diogenes
Menu needs populating
see github issues
it's easy to get perl warnings from diogenes; use it a bit and fix what's found
make settings page shorter and clearer - probably just a variant of firstrun page
consider changing the homepage interface so the 'what do you want to do' combobox is split out into a more sensible design
remove chrome/ dir and rename diogenes-browser/ to server/ or similar
headword in word lookup used to include macrons etc. probably don't want that now, but would be good to check with Peter what's most desirable.
try to restart diogenes-server if it is killed
